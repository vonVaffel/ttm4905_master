The indoor mapping service \gls{mm} started as a venture from Wireless Trondheim, an R\&D company working closely (and cooperating) with \gls{ntnu} whose goal it is to create sustainable ventures from new ideas. MazeMap's main service is providing an indoor mapping service aimed at large institutions such as universities, hospitals, conference venues, shopping malls and more. Users are able to access the service on any computer, tablet or smartphone, where the indoor maps themselves is the main focal point. Navigation services are also available in many different forms, but using Wi-Fi is a readily available and easily deployed solution which has been co-developed with Cisco. This particular service uses a technique called trilateration\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BiczokMJK14}, and is easily implemented as it uses existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to facilitate the service.
